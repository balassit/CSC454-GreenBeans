## New activity files:
To look at the format of the new activity.xml file, go to Android Studio and use the view "Design". This is also helpful for modifying the format when there are major adjustments to make. The "Text" view is helpful once you understand what is required for each xml file.

1. A new activity file is essentially a view for the next screen on the phone. 
2. If you click a button on one page, it will direct you to the next activty. 
3. Each activity has supporting java files
  - Java files will contain the strings and lists data that the activity receives.
